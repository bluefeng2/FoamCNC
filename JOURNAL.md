This is my journal of the design and building process of **Foam CNC**.

## 10/18/2025 - Preliminary sketches & some CAD  

To begin, before designing the CNC itself, I cadded the Nema 17 motors I chose for this project, and I sketched out a rough idea of what I want the CNC to look like. The entire CNC will be 3d printed, and roughly 15x15x15 cm. Each axis will be controlled by one Nema 17, using 3 in total.

The X (forward/back), Z (up/down) axes will be part of one CoreXY movement, and the Y (rotation) axis will be a geared down stepper.

Additionally, I cadded out the Nema 17 motor I will be using. I have quite a strange variant of Nema 17, and could not find it online. I also cadded out a limit switch using 5x5mm mouse switches, because I had them laying around. These should be the electronic components I will be using within the actual build, with the rest being outside of the main build (controller, drivers, etc).
